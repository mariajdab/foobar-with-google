# Google Foobar challenges and solutions


 I was searching in Google for something related to Python optimization and I got an unexpected invitation to a challenge that appeared to be very unusual...

but, with my insatiable curiosity I accepted it, of course  :) 

Later, I realized it's a programming challenge by Google that the people can get it based on their search history or by a friend invitation.
Here, I would like to share the interesting problems that I encountered and my solutions to them. 

A bit of context:

After accepting the invitation and link it with my email account, I saw a terminal kind, typing "help" I saw all I need to get started. For example, to get a challenge, I needed to type "request" then automatically I will have a folder in the workspace, the name folder will be the challenge name and an important thing is after requested the challenge ***the time starts to run***. You can see it in the image below, there I already had requested the challenge. 


The firts challenge (level 1) was: **the-cake-is-not-a-lie.**

If I move to the challenge folder I was able see some files:
- **readme.txt** (typing "cat readme.txt" you will see the challenge)
- **constraints.txt** (where see the limitations)
- **solution.py**     (where put Python code solution)
- **Solution.java**   (where put Java code solution)

## Constraints

I chose to work my solutions with Python
